## 💻 Contribute Code Changes

### For Non-Badge Work (Documentation, Fixes, Features)

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click Fork button on GitHub
   ```

2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/github-actions-learning.git
   cd github-actions-learning
   ```

3. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   
   Branch naming conventions:
   - `feature/description` - New features
   - `fix/description` - Bug fixes
   - `docs/description` - Documentation updates
   - `test/description` - Adding tests

4. **Make your changes**
   - Edit files as needed

   - For code: Update sample app or workflows
   - Test your changes locally

5. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Clear, descriptive message"
   ```
   
   Good commit messages:
   - Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
   - Keep it short (50 chars or less)
   - Reference issues: "Fix #123"

6. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
